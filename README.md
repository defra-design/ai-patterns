## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DEFRA/ai-defra-search-frontend.git
cd ai-defra-search-frontend
npm install
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project from the example template:

```bash
cp .example.env .env
```

Update the values in `.env` as needed for your local environment.

The following environment variables can be configured for the application:

| Variable | Required | Default | Description                                                              |

| `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` | Yes      | `eu-west-2` | The default AWS region (should match AWS_REGION)                         |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Yes      | `test` | AWS access key ID (use `test` for local development with Localstack)     |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Yes      | `test` | AWS secret access key (use `test` for local development with Localstack) |
| `PROTOTYPE_PASSWORD` | No       | - | Password protection for the prototype                                    |
| `API_BASE_URL` | Yes      | - | ai-defra-search-agent chat API URL                                       |
| `AUTH_ENABLED` | No       | `true` | Enable or disable authentication                                         |
| `MS_ENTRA_TENANT_ID` | Yes       | - | Microsoft Entra tenant ID                                                |

## Running the Application

### Building the Docker Image

Container images are built using Docker Compose. First, build the Docker image:

```bash
docker compose build
```

### Starting the Docker Container

After building the image, run the service locally in a container alongside Redis:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Use the `-d` flag at the end of the above command to run in detached mode (e.g., if you wish to view logs in another application such as Docker Desktop):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

To stop the containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Tests

### Running Tests

Run the tests with:

```bash
npm run docker:test
```

This command will:
1. Stop any running containers
2. Build the service
3. Run the test suite
4. Generate coverage reports in the `./coverage` directory

## Security Scanning

### Trivy Vulnerability Scan

[Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) is used to scan for security vulnerabilities in dependencies and the filesystem. The scan runs automatically via GitHub Actions and checks for CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW severity issues.

#### Running Trivy Locally

To run the Trivy scan locally, first install Trivy by following the [installation instructions](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/getting-started/installation/).

Once installed, run the scan from the project root:

```bash
trivy repository --include-dev-deps --format table --exit-code 1 --severity CRITICAL,HIGH,MEDIUM,LOW --ignorefile .trivyignore .
```

The scan will:
- Check the entire repository for vulnerabilities
- Respect ignore rules defined in `.trivyignore`
- Exit with code 1 if any vulnerabilities are found

## Server-side Caching

We use Catbox for server-side caching. By default, the service will use CatboxRedis when deployed and CatboxMemory for local development. You can override the default behavior by setting the `SESSION_CACHE_ENGINE` environment variable to either `redis` or `memory`.

Please note: CatboxMemory (`memory`) is _not_ suitable for production use! The cache will not be shared between each instance of the service and it will not persist between restarts.
